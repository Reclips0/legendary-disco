I took website requests from people.
I am now putting every single website into one website because I use react and with react you can just do that
## current requests
### Bingus man: random square.
When asked what he wanted to be random about the square, he simply replied "everything" so I did everything I could
### Cactus: Description of macaroni in excrutiating detail using the font "bungee" from google fonts.
I don't plan on using any AI for the code because I actually want to learn this stuff but I really don't have the time do describe macaroni so I used chatGPT for that but if anything chatGPT made it funnier than I could have
### Person 3 (anonymous): uranium reactor
if the reactor is clicked 25 times then the page blows up. Please, do not click the nuclear reactor I actually really love this website
### Me: Macaroni Clicker
It's cookie clicker but with macaroni. You will bake macaroni. You will eat the macaroni. You will macaroni until you die to a nuclear reactor explosion
### Jackson: Kanye clicker, accessible through a weekly vote
i didn't want to do this but oh well.
